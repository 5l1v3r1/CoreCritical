Tools
-------------------------
You need following tools to compile the final entry from source files. 
  
* Shader Minifier 1.1.6 (https://github.com/laurentlb/Shader_Minifier)
    * For minimizing shaders
* Google Closure Compiler v20180610 (https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/)
    * For minimizing javascript
* JsExe 1.1.1 (http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=59298)
    * For compressing final entry into PNG
* Python 3
    * For running the compile.py script
* Java
    * For running Closure Compiler
    
For copyright reasons none of the tools are included here and you must download them yourself. Place shader_minifier.exe, jsexe.exe and closure-compiler-v20180610.jar into the root folder of the project or modify their paths in compile.py. Then run compile.py to produce the final <=4096 byte entry file.
